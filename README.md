# hand_guster_recognition
Hand gesture recognition system is used for interfacing between computer and human using hand gesture. I wish to make a windows-based application for live motion gesture recognition using webcam. This project is a combination of live motion detection and gesture identification. This application uses the webcam to detect gesture made by the user and perform basic operations accordingly. The user has to perform a particular gesture.
